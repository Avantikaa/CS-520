# CS-520-SAGA

A Python-based implementation of MLOps workflows.

Experimental evaluation of MLFlow and a custom pipeline built using different components / libraries (Wandb for tracking experiments, Github Actions for designing the workflow). 

(client-server + pipelines architecture)
![Design](https://ml-ops.org/img/mlops-phasen.jpg)
UI Capabilities offloaded to the frameworks.

Challenges with ML deployment (Focus Points):
● Version control (code/data/model for reproducibility)
● Testing (Model Validation)
● Monitoring performance in production
● Automation (CI/CD for training/serving pipelines)
● Scalability

### Evaluation Criterion:
● Traceability - monitoring and logging the entire ML Lifecycle.
● Data Storage - compatibility with external data sources.
● Model Registry - model lineage, model versioning, stage transitions.
● Visualization - dashboarding capabilities.
● Stability
● Scalability
● Usability
● Maintainability
● Ease of automation

Note: Add a sample workflow for image classification on CIFAR.
